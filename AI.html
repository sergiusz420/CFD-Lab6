		<h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>

		<h2>AI Definition</h2>
		<p>
			<a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"

				>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a
			>
			refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks
			typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include
			problem-solving, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and
			making decisions.

        <h2>Key Concepts in AI</h2>
        <p>In relation to artificial intelligence,
            the following key concepts can be distinguished:
            <ol>
                <li>Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI
                    that allows systems to learn from data and improve
                    over time without being explicitly programmed.
                    Examples include recommendation systems (like
                    Netflix or YouTube) and fraud detection.</li>
                <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP): A branch of AI
                    focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret,
                    and generate human language. Applications include voice
                    assistants like Siri or Alexa, chatbots, and language
                    translation systems.</li>
                <li>Computer Vision: Enables machines to interpret
                    and make decisions based on visual data from the world,
                    such as images and videos. It's widely used in facial
                    recognition, self-driving cars, and medical imaging.</li>
                <li>Robotics: AI powers robots, giving them the ability
                    to perform tasks autonomously, often in environments
                    that are too dangerous or complex for humans.</li>
                <li>Expert Systems: AI-based systems designed to mimic
                    human expertise in specific domains, such as medical
                    diagnosis or financial decision-making.</li>
              </ol>
        </p>

		<h2>Examples of AI in Daily Life</h2>
		<p>
			AI is used as voice assistants.
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri" target="_blank">Siri</a>,
			Google Assistant, and Alexa use AI to understand and respond to voice
			commands. Platforms like Netflix and Amazon use AI to recommend products
			or shows based on your previous interactions. AI enables self-driving cars
			to navigate roads and make driving decisions.

		<h2>The Future of AI</h2>
		<p>
			AI continues to grow and impact various fields such as healthcare,
			education, finance, and manufacturing. However, ethical considerations,
			such as job displacement, privacy concerns, and AI safety, are also key
			topics of discussion. The development of AI is likely to reshape many
			industries and aspects of daily life in the years to come.

        <p>The data in the table shows four main areas of AI application:
            natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning,
            and reinforcement learning. Each area is related to a specific application,
            such as chatbots, medical image analysis systems, or autonomous vehicles.
            These applications have a significant impact on various sectors,
            improving the efficiency of customer service, medical diagnostics,
            protection against financial fraud, and the development of modern
            technologies such as self-driving cars.</p>
